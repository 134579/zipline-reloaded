Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

This release updates Zipline to be compatible with Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 as well as current version of relevant PyData libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and others.

Conda packages for zipline and key dependencies are now available for Python 3.7-3.9 on the 'ml4t' Anaconda channel. Binary wheels are available for Linux ( Python 3.7-3.9) and MacOSx (3.7 and 3.8).

As part of the update, the ``BlazeLoader`` functionality was removed. It was built on the `Blaze Ecosystem <https://blaze.pydata.org/>`_. Unfortunately, the three relevant projects (`Blaze <https://blaze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, `Odo <https://odo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `datashape <https://datashape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ have received very limited support over the last several years.
